# Viewing and saving your visualisation

In the web application, you can hover your mouse over the heatmap cells or lollipop bulbs to display more information about a specific datum. This is useful for larger jobs where the labels may appear off-screen. Coordinate labels can be repositioned by clicking and dragging the text.

You have the option to customise the drawing in the options pane above the visualisation. See the section 'Drawing options' below for more information.

To download the visualisation as a static image, click the 'download' button below the drawing options pane, then select the output format.

Formats include:

* PNG, with white background
* PNG, with transparent background

*QUICK TIP:* For large jobs which display many proteins down the page, your horizontal scrollbar may be positioned off your screen. You can still scroll left and right by holding down the SHIFT key and scrolling with your mouse.
