## About

PTM VisQuant is a tool for displaying accurate positions of experimentally determined post-translational modifications (PTMs) relative to evolutionarily conserved protein domains.

All you need to do is provide

1. the protein entry name or accession (for example, BSN_RAT or O88778), and
2. a file listing phosphorylation sites, optional custom colouring, and quantitative data.
