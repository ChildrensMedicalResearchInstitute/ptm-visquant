PTM Mapper is a tool for displaying accurate positions of experimentally determined post-translational modifications (PTMs) relative to evolutionarily conserved protein domains.

*INSTRUCTIONS*: Provide the protein entry name or accession (for example, BSN_RAT or O88778) and a file listing phosphorylation sites, optional custom colouring, and quantitative data (see [HOW TO](/how-to)).
