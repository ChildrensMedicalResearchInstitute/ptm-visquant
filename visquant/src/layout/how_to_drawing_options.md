## Drawing options

Options for changing the appearance of the drawing will appear after you click the 'Visualise' button.

### Visualisation

Quantitative data can be viewed as either heatmaps below the protein or as lollipops stemming from the protein backbone.

In heatmap view, each protein will be drawn once and experimental trials will appear as rows on the heatmap below each protein. In lollipop view, each protein will be repeated for each experimental trial. Trial labels appear on the far right side of the protein in both visualisation modes.

### Image scale

You can horizontally scale the image and the distance between tick marks under the 'image scale' options. By default, the application draws the protein at 1 pixel per amino acid residue (100%) and draws a tick on the scale axis every 500 amino acid residues.

### Heatmap

'Minimum' and 'maximum' options allow you to adjust the heatmap range. The 'colour scheme' options allow you to choose from a variety of diverging and sequential colour scales to visualise your data.

### Lollipop

You can increase or decrease the heights of the lollipops by adjusting the 'scale height' setting. The 'tick distance' option will allow you to customise the distance between the tick marks on the lollipop height axis.

By default, the lollipops are coloured as they appear in the heatmap view. You can choose to colour the lollipops based on whether they are upregulated (positive intensity) or downregulated (negative intensity) by selecting the 'colour' checkbox.
